# CineKeep

CineKeep is a TMDb-powered movie and TV discovery app. It is basically my take on an IMDb-style browsing experience: search for titles and people, browse curated lists, open detailed pages, and move through cast, episodes, reviews, videos, and photos.

This project uses the TMDb API for data and images. It is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

## What It Does

- Home page with trending titles, popular picks, people, trailers, TV airing today, streaming arrivals, and upcoming movies
- Movie and TV detail pages with overview, cast and crew, episodes, videos, photos, and reviews
- Search across movies, TV series, and people
- Browse pages for popular, top-rated, now-playing, upcoming, and airing titles
- Person detail pages with credits and photos
- Collection pages and streaming/provider browsing
- Account-related pages for watchlists, favorites, ratings, and lists where TMDb account access is available
